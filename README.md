# Machine-Learning-From-Scratch
Two scripts; single layer perceptron and boosted trees coded from scratch


The main functions in the boosted trees script and perceptron scrip currently return the testing error rate given a training set and a test set. Both can easily be modified to return the predictions by changing the final lines of the adaboost() and perceptron() functions to return(test['Yhat']).

Happy predicting!
